# Surfaces Visualization Images

This directory contains automatically generated visualization images for all Surfaces test functions.

## Directory Structure

### `mathematical/`
Contains heatmap and surface plots for mathematical optimization test functions:
- **2D Functions**: Ackley, Beale, Booth, Himmelblau's, etc.
- **N-D Functions**: Sphere, Rastrigin, Rosenbrock, etc. (visualized as 2D slices)

### `ml_functions/`
Contains hyperparameter analysis plots for machine learning test functions:
- **Hyperparameter Interactions**: Heatmaps showing how parameters interact
- **Dataset Analysis**: Performance patterns across different datasets

### `ml_functions/detailed/`
Contains detailed plots organized by ML function for comprehensive analysis.

## Image Generation

Images are automatically generated by GitHub Actions workflow using:
- `scripts/generate_all_plots.py` - Mathematical function visualizations  
- `scripts/generate_ml_plots.py` - ML function analysis plots

## Usage in README

All images are referenced in the main README.md file to showcase the library's visualization capabilities.
